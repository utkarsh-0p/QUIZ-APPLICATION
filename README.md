# QUIZ-APPLICATION
The Quiz Application is a lightweight, browser-based quiz game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to test their knowledge by answering multiple-choice questions. Each question has four options, and users can select one answer before submitting. At the end of the quiz, the application displays the userâ€™s total score and provides an option to restart the quiz.

This project is great for beginners to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and JavaScript logic building. It can be easily extended with features like timers, progress bars, random questions, or saving scores to local storage.
